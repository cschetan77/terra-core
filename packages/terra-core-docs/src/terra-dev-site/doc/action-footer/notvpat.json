    "Description": "An action footer is a user interface (UI) component that provides common actions in the form of pre-arranged buttons and hyperlinks, as well as dividers to segment groups of actions. Action footers are the lowest level of content within a container and can be used within the layout of a page to divide and organize content in meaningful ways. They provide the users with actions that can be associated with the content that lives within the container.\n This solution includes the following components: Standard Action Footer\n- Single Start Action\n- Centered Action Footer\n- Multiple Start and End Actions\nCenterted Action Footer\n- Single  Action\n- Multiple Actions\nBlock Action Footer\n- Single  Action\n- Multiple Actions",
